# Cursor Rules – Portfolio (Next.js / TypeScript)

## Sources of Truth (in priority order)
1) docs/context.md — project goals, content, preferences
2) src/app/layout.tsx — global metadata/fonts
3) README.md (if present)

## Assistant Workflow
- Always read and cross-reference docs/context.md before starting a task.
- If user or assistant changes scope/requirements, update docs/context.md first.
- Keep this .cursorrules aligned with docs/context.md; update when norms change.
- Prefer static-first solutions compatible with static export.

## Coding Preferences
- Preserve existing indentation, formatting, and style; avoid unrelated reformatting.
- Use functional React components with clear, descriptive names.
- Favor early returns and minimal complexity; avoid unnecessary try/catch.
- Keep code linter-clean; fix introduced lint errors immediately.
- Use semantic HTML and accessibility best practices.

## Performance & Bundle
- Minimize client-side JS; avoid heavy UI libraries unless requested.
- Optimize images and use responsive sizes.

## SEO & Metadata
- Maintain accurate title/description; add OpenGraph/Twitter tags when adding pages.

## Data & Content
- Prefer static content (MDX/JSON) for bios/projects.
- Store featured projects with title, summary, tech, demo URL, repo URL.

## Guardrails
- Do not introduce server-only features for core pages.
- Do not change fonts/color system without user approval.
- Do not add large dependencies without consulting the user.

## Operational Notes
- Large/generated folders should be ignored via .cursorignore: node_modules, .next, dist, out.
- When in doubt, ask for minimal clarifications; otherwise proceed with sensible defaults in docs/context.md.
